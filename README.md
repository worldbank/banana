# Survey on National Education Responses to COVID-19 School Closures

This repository hosts the **UNESCO-UNICEF-WBG Survey on National education responses to COVID-19**. It contains the raw data collected in the survey plus all the programs used to clean it and analyze it.

## This Survey 

As part of the coordinated global education response to the COVID-19 pandemic, UNESCO, UNICEF and the World Bank conducted a Survey on National Education Responses to COVID-19 School Closures. In this joint report, the results of the first two rounds of data collection administered by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) were analysed. They cover government responses to school closures from pre-primary to secondary education.

This survey by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Bank seeks to collect information on national education responses to school closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire ([round1 (English)](http://tcg.uis.unesco.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/06/covid-19_school_closure_questionnaire_en.pdf), [round2 (English)](http://tcg.uis.unesco.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/Joint-Survey-2.0-FINAL_EN.pdf), [questionnaires in Frech, Spanish, Russian, Arabic can be found in the main survey](http://tcg.uis.unesco.org/survey-education-covid-school-closures/)) is designed for Ministry of Education officials at central or decentralized level in charge of school education. The questionnaire does not cover higher education or technical and vocational education and training. Analysis of results will allow for policy learning across the diversity of country settings in order to better inform local/national responses and prepare for the reopening of schools.

  - [Key findings of the second round](https://infogram.com/key-findings-1hxr4z5ynon74yo?live)

The survey will be run on a regular basis to ensure that the latest impact and responses are captured. In light of the current education crisis, the COVID-19 education response coordinated by UNESCO with our partners is deemed urgent.

   - First round of data collection (April to June/2020) ([Technical report 1](http://tcg.uis.unesco.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/COVID-SURVEY_technical-note-20200702.pdf), [data round1](http://tcg.uis.unesco.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/Response_final_20200720.xls))
